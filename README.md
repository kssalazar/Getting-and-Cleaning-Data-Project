# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project contains an R script that does the following:
1. Download the data from the web
2. Read training, test, features, and activity labels
3. Assign column names
4. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
5. Create a tidy data set that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The tidy data set output is saved in setMean.txt
